Here is a block of code that's intended to exhibit the title of a certain book from a library catalog. 
However, it contains a flaw preventing it from displaying the right title. Can you identify the problem and correct 
it to ensure it prints the accurate book title? Let's see you apply what you've just learned about HashMap in Java!
